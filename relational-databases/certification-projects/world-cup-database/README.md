In this certification project, I was tasked to create a database of world cup games and write SQL queries to answer some questions about the data.

I had to:

- Create the normalized database schema
- Create a bash script to insert all data from the .csv
- Fill out the required queries in queries.sh

Overall, this was a great hands on project and solidified my understanding. 

Also, increased my confidence as I got everything done fairly quick.
