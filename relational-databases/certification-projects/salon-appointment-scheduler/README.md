This project is a salon appointment scheduler written in bash with a corresponding SQL database.

Stack:
SQL & Bash

How it works:
  - Start the salon.sh script to schedule an appointment
  - Choose what service you would like
  - Input your phone number
    - If you've scheduled with us before, then your data has been saved and you can continue to book a time for an appointment
    -If you haven't, then input your name and then book your time for your appointment
  - Done! Your appointment is scheduled.

This project utilizes a bash script with user inputs through the terminal and inputs this data accurately into a SQL relational database.
