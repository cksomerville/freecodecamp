This project was an intensive practice of SQL QUERY.

In part 1, I created the students database and its normalized schema, and in this part I practiced complex queries with the db writing in bash.

This practice included simple SELECT QUERY with WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE/ILIKE, IS NULL/IS NOT NULL, ORDER BY, LIMIT, ROUND, COUNT, AVG, MIN/MAX, DISTINCT, etc. 
Along with these queries I practiced JOIN with FULL JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT JOIN, and my personal favorite INNER JOIN. 

This was a lesson I was really looking forward to since I have started to manage my own databases of financial data that I use in my stock analysis. The skill to write complex queries will be extremely beneficial to my research and help me continue to make the best software tools for financial analysts. Excited to use these in my own db's like my insider trades db.

Overall, great project. Thoroughly enjoyed. Though it got a bit tricky at the end.
