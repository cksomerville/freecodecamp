This project was to test my skills building a relational database with a bash script to read and write to the db.

The file bike-shop.sh is a script that allows users to rent a bike and return a bike. The script will record rentals and what bikes are being used at given time. The db is automatically updated for rentals and allows users to then return the bikes which will update the status of the rental and update a return date.

To try use the sql dump to create the db, then give bike-shop.sh executable permissions (chmod +x bike-shop.sh), and then finally run the script and rent and return away!

Overall this was a really enjoyable project and I'm really looking forward to using this in my own programs for my stock investing and research.
