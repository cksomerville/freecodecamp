This project shows my ability to create databases in PSQL and insert bulk data using bash scripts.

For this project, I had to create a simple PSQL database for students and their courses, then insert the .csv files I was given into the database using bash scripts.

Overall, it was a fun project and was satisfying to insert everything correctly by executing a single file.
