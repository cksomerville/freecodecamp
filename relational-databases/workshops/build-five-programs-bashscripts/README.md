Built five scripts within bash. These scripts use for loops, while loops, and if then statements.

This solidified my knowledge on bash terminal scripting and executing scripts.

bingo.sh is a random number generator with if then statements to determine the letter associated with number.
fortune.sh is an array with a function that determines the response via a random number generator.
questionnaire.sh is a simple read and echo back responses with the read variables inputted by the user.
countdown.sh is a countdown timer using a while loop, but also has an if then statement commented out to show both methods.
five.sh is a script to start the rest of the scripts at the same time.
