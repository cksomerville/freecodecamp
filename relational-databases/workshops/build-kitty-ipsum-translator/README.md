This workshop was a bash crash course on commands like grep, sed, cat, wc, diff and their flags.

In this lesson I was given two text files kitty_ipsum_1.txt and kitty_ipsum_2.txt and was task with gathering details about these files and creating a script to translate the "kitty ipsum" into "doggy ipsum" which essentially was replacing all 'cat' 'meow' 'meowzer' with 'dog' or 'woof'. I did these tasks using bash commands to gather data about the files and then created a very very simple script, translate.sh, which uses cat to enter a given files contents then pipes the stdout to a sed that then replaces all cat references to dog references. 

These lessons allow me to search files for different phrases. Kind of like the terminals command F with grep and even more capabilities with wc to find lines amongst other things.

Also, learned about the stdin, stout, and stderror concepts within bash that showed me how bash operates. In addition to appends, I also learned how to pipe commands to allow for continuous commands using the same stdin and stdout architecture.

Overall, good lesson although this one was pretty boring. I know I'll have to use it so this was good practice.
